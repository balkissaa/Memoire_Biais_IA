This folder contains the scripts used to quantitatively evaluate bias in the **FairCVdb** dataset with the IBM AI Fairness 360  library.

### Scripts

- **`faircvtestexp_gender_aif360.py`**  
  Computes several fairness metrics (Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, Average Odds Difference, Error Rate Difference, Disparate Impact, Accuracy) based on the **predicted scores biased by gender**.  
  Produces a CSV file summarizing the results.

- **`faircvtestexp_neutral_aif360.py`**  
  Performs the same evaluation on **neutral predicted scores (without explicit bias)**.  
  Serves as a reference comparison against the biased scenario.  
  Also produces a CSV summary of the results.
